## 🔌 Environment / Database

- **Temporary:** Neon (serverless Postgres over TLS) via `DATABASE_URL` + `DB_SSL=true` —
  unblocks live migrations + verification without Docker.
- **Target:** Docker Compose (`docker compose up --build`) once Docker Desktop is installed.
- App supports both: a single `DATABASE_URL` (Neon) **or** discrete `DB_*` fields (compose).
- **Repo:** github.com/GeeteshJangir/TaskSchedulingPlatform (`main`). Commit per module/phase with conventional messages; `.env` is gitignored so the Neon secret stays local.

## ✅ Live verification — DONE on Neon (2026-06-05)
- [x] `npm run migration:run` applied M0–M6 (`migration:show` → all `[X]`); revert not yet exercised
- [x] App boots; `/api/health` readiness = `database: up`; Swagger at `/docs`
- [x] E2E happy path: signup → /users/me → create workspace (slug auto) → create project → keyset list
- [x] RBAC/auth negatives: non-member GET/POST → 403; no token → 401
- [x] Refresh rotation + reuse detection (replayed revoked token → 401)
- [x] Invite → accept over HTTP (User A invites → User B accepts as MEMBER)
- [x] MEMBER can create projects (post-tweak); DELETE still 403 (ADMIN-only)
- Note: Neon us-east-1 latency ~400–600 ms/query; readiness ping timeout raised to 5 s.

## 📝 Decisions / deviations from original plan
- M0 enables extensions only; enums created lazily in the migration that first needs them.
- Refresh tokens hashed with **SHA-256** (high-entropy → fast deterministic lookup); passwords use **argon2**.
- Refresh tokens are **opaque** (revocable), not JWTs.
- Test runner: `--runInBand` + `isolatedModules` (constrained-memory machine).
- **Projects: any member can create/edit; only ADMIN deletes** (P3 tweak; differs from the original ADMIN-only matrix, per request).

## 🛠️ How to maintain this file
1. Tick `[ ]` → `[x]` as items complete; flip the phase status emoji.
2. Recompute: overall % = (checked items ÷ 75) × 100; update the bar + header.
3. Keep "pending live verification" honest — only tick after a real run.
